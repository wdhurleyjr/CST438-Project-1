## Overview
This is a soccer stat app that makes use of an API we found [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file).

We got styling help for this document from [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction

* How was communication managed<br/>
  We used Slack and Zoom to communicate. 
* How many stories/issues were initially considered<br/>
  We initially had 12 issues which became 19 over time.
* How many stories/issues were completed<br/>
  At the end we had completed 11 issues.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I worked on creating the login page, create account page, setting up the API/ SQLite database functionality, and associated tests.

+ What was the biggest challenge?<br/>
  The biggest challenge that I faced was learning how to create a react native app and app setup. 
+ Why was it a challenge?<br/>
  This was challenging because I had never done it before.
  + How was the challenge addressed?<br/>
    I addressed these challenges through some research and by reading documentation.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project<br/>
   I've always felt like working with an API and then displaying that data in an app was always super cool.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?<br/>
   I would have drawn out a flow diagram of the application before writing any code. I feel like this would have    eliminated some confusion on the team.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?<br/>
  The most valuable thing that I learned was React Native. I feel like I will be using this in the future for      projects and or for entrapanural type opportunities.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was to create and populate the team page and make the user stories for the app.

+ What was the biggest challenge?<br/>
  My biggest challenge was working with the API. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + How was the challenge addressed?<br/>
  It was a challenge mainly because it would not work on my computer, so I reached out and got help from my team   to help review my work.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project<br/>
  I think that using react native was very interesting as it allowed us to make the project quickly.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?<br/>
  I think a few things I would change would be the amount of time we had to complete the project and being able    to use a different database as Sqlite has its limitations.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?<br/>
  I think the most valuable thing I learned was time management and how to work in a team. Truly it is important   to start fast, stay organized, and communicate often.

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - Think in terms of what did you set out to do and what actually got done?<br/>
  Overall the project was successful for the amount of time given. In three weeks we created a project that 
  allows a user to create an account, login, and view various soccer leagues and teams. We would have liked to 
  have more information about players shown and to allow the user to view the different games occurring that 
  day, but that would be something to do in the future.
- What was the largest victory?<br/>
  The largest victory was getting the API and database to work together as it allowed us to work on many   different parts of the project.
- Final assessment of the project<br/>
  The project was a wonderful experience that allowed us to learn react native, sqlite, and how to use git and     github. It brought us a better understanding of the importance of communication and project management  frameworks like the agile process.
